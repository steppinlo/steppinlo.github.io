      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a Bay Area native currently residing in NYC and attending Dev Bootcamp at their NYC campus. Prior to DBC, I attended CSU East Bay and graduated with a BA in Economics. I then moved out to NYC and was a technical recruiter, placing top technologists at various startups/banks/hedge funds/etc. During my tenure at CSUEB, I took a few programming courses (learning C++) and was a few courses short of completing a minor in CS.</p>
       <p>Strangely enough, it was during my job as a recruiter that I realized my passion for engineering. Talking to developers on a daily basis, ranging from front-end developers all the way up to data scientists and CTOs, made me realized that I too wanted to be in that field. I have always been passionate about technology and being able to combine my fascination of technology to my career would be the ultimate dream.</p>
      <p>Other things about me include avid traveler and total sports nut. I've been to well over 20 countries and it is an ambition of mine to hit up all 7 continents (3 more to go!). As a San Francisco native, I am a die-hard Giants, Niners, Warriors, and Sharks fan.</p>
