      As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "Life is a journey, not a destination." This quote could not apply any more to what is to come at DBC. Sure, we will eventually learn the tools that will enable us to become strong developers, but it's all the hurdles, mistakes, and triumphs that are more important than the final destination. Getting stuck and pulling my hair out doesn't sound the greatest, but the irony is that is what will make me a better developer. We learn best from our mistakes and challenging ourselves.

      The program so far has been what I expected. What I do appreciate is that they have both video and text. There are certain things where I'd rather quickly read through the tasks and some where I would prefer a video that I can myself emulate. Sure, I came across a few issues here and there, but having both options allowed me to see where I went wrong. In all honesty, this is exactly what I expected out of the program. I'm learning by doing. Reptitions is what will get it into my memory and also understand how and why it is done. This is the optimal environment for me to learn. I grew up in an educational environment where the grade on your paper was the most important attribute. Here it is actually learning. I couldn't be more excited.
