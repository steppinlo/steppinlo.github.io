  <h1>Ruby vs Javascript: Looping</h1><BR>
  <h4>2/8/2015</h4>

  <section="body">
    <p>In the first 6 weeks of this course, we've pretty gone knee-deep in ruby, learning the loops, how to use them, and implementing them in an effective manner. This past week, we were introduced to javascript. The idea is pretty similar, they both have relatively the same commands (syntax is the only thing different), and it was not too difficult to pick up. But as noted, syntax is different. Understanding where the difference lies is important for not just javascript, but any other language that we pick up along the way (something that I've iterated over and over again. I think at this point it's become an endless loop). To be frank, I find Ruby much simpler than Javascript. There are less things to be nitpicky about and more things are assumed. However, that can cause a lot of restrictions as well. So in this week's blog I'll be looking at looping for both languages. </p>
    <span class = "subtitle">For loops</span>
    <p>Why don't we go ahead and look at the two examples:</p>
<xmp class = "codeBoxLeft">#Ruby for-loop
for i in 1..5
  print i
end

#==>prints 12345 onto screen.
</xmp>
<xmp class = "codeBoxRight">//JavaScript for-loop
for (i=1; i<=5; i++) {
  console.log();
}

// prints out 1 2 3 4 5 on separate lines
</xmp>
<p>Very simple, but it does enough to show the simple subtleties. First off, you can see that the parameters set up in ruby is very straight forward. No brackets needed, no characters needed for that matter. You will set up a variable to represent the argument, and have the counter reach to a certain number from a particular start.</p>
<p>JavaScript is where it gets a bit interesting. For me, learning Javascript this week reminded me of the meticulousness of C++ I would get annoyed with (semicolons semicolons semicolons! You forget one and you get a million errors!). So in this scenario, all the parameters will need to be set. In this case, where in Ruby you would set the range, here we had to set up the starting point and what the final number would be. A third parameter was also set for the counter.</p>
<p>Here is where a significant difference lies between the two languages. In Ruby, you cannot skip any numbers. There is no forumla you can add. In JavaScript, on the other hand, you can set the counter to have different things. Example below:</p>
<xmp>for(i=2; i<=64; i*2){
  console.log(i);
  i=i*2 
}

//Displayed would be 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64
</xmp>
<p>To be honest you probably could set conditionals in the Ruby for loop (if/else) that would be able to do the same thing, but there would be a lot more processing/code in comparison to JavaScript. Overall, in JavaScript, I feel that there is a lot more control in what you want to accomplish.</p>
<span class="subtitle">While loops</span>
<p>While loops are a bit more similar between these two languages. There's no significant difference that we wouldn't have encountered already from the for loop. So let's look at a quick example:</p>
<xmp class = "codeBoxLeft">#Ruby Code
n = 1
while n <= 5 do
  print n
  n+=1
end

#will print out 12345
</xmp>
<xmp class = "codeBoxRight">//JavaScript code
var i = 1
while (i<=5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

//prints out 1 2 3 4 5 on different lines.
</xmp>
<p>Another syntax to note is that there is no ++ in Ruby. As noted before, there is nothing too significant of a difference other than the specifics required by each of the languages.</p>
<p>Those are the two loops that can be compared. Obviously in Ruby, there are a lot more other types of loop methods that can be used (e.g. #map/#collect and #each) and they all have their different usages in comparison to the for loop, but that is a whole other discussion. </p>
