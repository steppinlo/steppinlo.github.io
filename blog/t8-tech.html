  <h1>How the Internet Works</h1><BR>
  <h4>2/14/2014</h4>

  <section="body">
    <p>It's funny, when it comes to the internet, no one really thinks about how it works. Of course with the net neutrality debate, people are actually piecing together a lot of the jargon and understanding how it works. Perhaps in that sense, we'll figure out if having net neutrality is beneficial for us all or not.</p>
    <h3>So how does it work?</h3>
    <p>For starters, we all are aware that we connect to the internet via an ISP (Internet Service Provider), or as many of us know it as companies such as Verizon, Time Warner, Comcast, etc. It is through these companies that our computers get connected to a network. So essentially, the internet is a large network of many smaller networks. From here, we connect to each ISP's Point in Presence, a place for local users to access the company's network. All of these POPs are then connecting to each other via Network Access Points. </p>
    <h3>How do we get the information?</h3>
    <p>Well the answer can be as complicated as you want it to be. We connect to the internet through hardware, which can be cables that carry reabits of information or also routers, servers, cell phone towers, satellites, etc. These are what connects the network of networks mentioned earlier. However, without Protocols, none of these hardware would be able to create the network. </p>
    <p>Protocols set the rules that the machines follow to complete the tasks, basically setting a common language for all machines to use to transmit data. The two main protocols are transmission control protocol (TCP) and internet protocol (IP). These protocols establish rules for how information passes through the internet, because without them, you would require direct connections to other computers to access the information you are trying to obtain.</p>
    <p>Everyone is familiar with IP address (or the 9 digit code that's on your computer in the form of nnn.nnn.nnn that makes zero sense). Each computer has a unique IP address, which is how one machine can find the other. So when you do want to send or receive information, your request goes over the network, pinging the domain name servers (DNS), which directs the request into the right direction. Upon getting a match, your request will be routed to the appropriate IP address and enter the network as requested. Series of packets that contain website information (i.e. headers, footers, information) will be sent back to the computer. So all the information on this site, for example, was sent to your computer in packets. It is then via the rules of the protocol that the packets be correctly placed, like a jigsaw puzzle. </p>
    <p>In a nutshell, the internet is a wire, connecting networks made up of many servers. Each server has its own unique IP address that allows computers to get routed to the right server. When retrieving or sending information, computers break it down into packets, which are then reassembled in its original order.</p>
