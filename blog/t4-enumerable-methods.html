  <h1>Enumerable methods: Map</h1><BR>
  <h4>1/18/2015</h4>
  <section class="body">
    <p>So this week was a bit of an adventure as I used #map/#map! quite a bit. I'll be honest, at first I was a bit confused as to what it actually did (then there was additional confusion for the ! operator). But to break it down, I figure it's good to discuss when it would be used in the first place. </p>
    <p>There's going to be a number of situations when you have a collection of data and you want to be able to do a number of things to it. Boiled down, #map will alter your array's object and return them in the same location. Now sometimes there might be situations where you want to be destructive, or permanently alter the array rather than static, in that case you would use #map!. Below is a case:
      <section class="ruby">
        <p>array = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]     #=>["a!", "b!", "c!", "d!"]</p>
        <p>array.map{|letter| letter +"!"}<p>
        <p>print array
        <p>#Output
        <p>["a", "b", "c", "d"]</p>
      </section>
    <p>As you can see, the array simply was altered in the line but was not actually mutated. However, we could have just have placed print on the same line as line 2. On the other hand, if we want to have the array be essentially replaced, #map! would be the method we would prefer to call:</p>
      <section class="ruby">
        <p>array = ["a", "b", "c", "d"] #=>["a!", "b!", "c!", "d!"]</p>
        <p>array.map!{|letter| letter +"!"}<p>
        <p>print array
        <p>#Output
        <p>["a!", "b!", "c!", "d!"]</p>
        <p></p>
      </section>
    <p><b>It is also worth noting that #collect/#collect! is an alias for #map/#map! and are completely interchangeable.</b></p>
    <p>Finally, having done some research, #map, and #each are relatively similar and will be heavily used by coders. However knowing the difference is key when it comes to progress. #each will iterate, or loop, through an array and pass the block that is specified within the code, but return the array as it originated. See the example below:</p>
      <section class="ruby">
        <p>array = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
        <p>array.each{|letter| print letter +"!"} #=> ["a", "b", "c", "d"]<p>
        <p>#Output
        <p>a!b!c!d!</p>
