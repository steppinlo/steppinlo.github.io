  <h2>Version Control</h2>
    <p>
    Version control is great in allowing engineers to see their code every step of the way. You can essentially narrow down where you may have introduced bugs or problems. Also, at some point, you might realize you want to scrap an entire idea that may have impacted in various areas that would be too complicated to go in and delete, so you can go to previous versions to axe the idea completely. Plus, since you can see who did what, if someone is really screwing around, you know who to go to! There is no anonymity with it!
    </p>
    <p>
    Bottom line, version control is pretty much <b>mandatory</b> in coding. You will want to track the changes you make, you will want checkpoints along the way, you will want to see who is and isn't helping out. 
    </p>
    <h2>Git changes</h2>
    <p>
    Git is a phenomenal way of actually logging the changes and seeing it implemented. You will actually see portions highlighted and noted so that you can see what was added/deleted/modified.

    <h2>Benefits of using GitHub</h2>
    <p>
    There are so many benefits with using Github! First of all, if you are working on a big project with multiple partners, it is such an efficient way of gathering all the files and being able to constantly update/share the documents. By having it on a virtual platform, you will also assure that there is a backup. If my computer suddenly crashed, I know I will be absolutely devastated if I lost my work. GitHub is not only a great sharing tool, but amazing for backup as well.
