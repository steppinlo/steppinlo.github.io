        I kind of feel like an idiot when it came to this, but for some reason I was just not getting the whole Chrome Devtools challenge. Then it hit me that all we had to do was adjust the padding and such. When it comes to, all three things are good in different things. Bottom line, each attribute impacts it in different ways that are significantly useful: margin impacts the distance outside the object, padding is inside, and padding is within the object</p>
        <p> To go in depth, margin has zero impact of what the shape or form that the object will result in. So for example, if I wanted to add/alter the margins, it would physically move the object to a specific location (e.g. margin-left 10px would move it 10px from the left). It's great if you have a specific image in mind that you want it to be in.</p>
        <p>With Padding, it allows some space, so if you have two items lined up right next to each other, you can actually put some buffer space or "padding" between the two objects. Or, if you have a text box with a border, you can have some padding all around. This will change the size of the block, so that is important to keep in mind.</p>
        <p>Border is pretty straight forward, you can put however many px you want your object to be bordered by and also change the state, whether it be solid or a dash.</p>
        <p>Overall all of these are pretty different, with padding/margin being the closest in similarity. The main thing to remember is that one impacts the outside (margin) and the other the inside (padding).
