  <h1>Tech Problems: Cloud Security</h1><BR>
  <h4>1/18/2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>In an age where everyone is looking to carry all their information on the go while as little as possible, many tech firms are looking to getting into cloud computing. Heck, firms such as Salesforce and Workday focus their work entirely on the cloud. Honestly, I remember a few years ago when cloud became the rage and people were claiming that hard drives would soon become obsolete. But do we really want personal information on a cloud? </p>
    <p>There are a good number of people who will have personal documents on their computers, whether it be for a duplicate record or just a more efficient record in comparison to having a physical copy that can get lost. If this were to be online in the cloud, it exposes the user to a number of dangers. If it is on a cloud, it is on a database of probably a much larger holding company. To be honest, this would make things a ton easier for a hacker! Usually a hacker will require an IP number in order to access a single computer's files, but for the cloud, they can hit a wider range of targets simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Case in point, with the major Apple hacking that took place sometime last year, would the files of the celebrities have been accessed? Possibly. Did it being on the cloud make it a lot easier? Definitely. Hackers don't require much to access the huge database. Heck, they don't require much just to have an isolated target. If they can figure out the email of the target, they can pretty much infiltrate. A problem with online security is its security measures. Most of the time it's a security question, and unless your answer is something random like "chicken pot pie", it's not going to be too difficult to figure out especially when you're a celebrity and all your information is made public.</p>
    <p>More and more companies are starting to store their information on a cloud. For the most part it is quicker and more cost effective than using a local drive. However, they will lack security visibility and risk awareness since the infrastructure will not be on their premesis. Say an attack were to occur at a particular company, how would the company learn of it? And how quickly would they be notified should data-loss occur.</p>
    <p>Honestly it will be interesting to see how this problem will be solved in the future. I can only think that further encryption and multiple security steps will be necessary to boost the security. It is well known that anything that is online is subject to being accessed by anyone. It's almost as if they have to isolate the data, as if it is an island, and have a chronic change in the encryption (akin to the Germans' code during WWII) so that no one will know the key at any given moment. </p>
