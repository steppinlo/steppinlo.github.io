    <p>
      Before Phase 0 started, the Gregoric Mind style I tested as was Concrete Random (i.e. experiment to find answers/work better with trial and error approaches). This definitely does apply, but I would say my learning crosses a number of areas. This definitely can play an advantage as there is never going to be one solution for a code. The wonderful thing about programming is that you can have a multitude of ways to get the task you want completed (some just might be more efficient than others!). </p>
      <p> So far Phase 0 has been a fairly smooth run, but that's mainly due to my familiarity with the material already. There have been a few struggles, but that's due to the ambiguity of the directions or the fact that I'm programming on Win when this is more geared towards OS. I'd imagine when we get into the next unit, I will have a bit more struggles, and my constant need to solve any problems via trial-and-error may cause me to pull a few hairs out. </p>
      <p>With the two varying mindsets, the fixed mindset to me is a bit childish as this person would be more inclined to their own thought and always take the easy road. Carol Dweck, a Stanford professor, found that those with growth mindsets think that character, intelligence, and creative abilities are inherent. Growth mindset thrives on challenges and looks at "failures" as a learning mechanism.</p>
      <p> The way I see it, you can almost view fixed vs growth as half glass empty vs half glass full. Growth is more optimistic and will turn the negatives into positives while those with fixed will take anything negative and use it as a reason to give up.</p>
      <p> In my path to become a developer, it is imperative that I do take on a growth mindset. Failures will fluster me, I'm sure of it. Especially with a Concrete Random mindset, where I prefer experimenting, I'd imagine I will come across this quite often. As long as I remember that I can learn from my failures as to what to avoid/what can be done, I will be on the right path.
