  <h1>Values</h1><BR>

  <section="body">
    <p>Values. Oh boy. This is an interesting one, given the background that I had growing up. List and value are below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accomplishment: 5</li>
        <li>Adventure: 4</li>
        <li>Close Relationships: 4</li>
        <li>Commitment: 3</li>
        <li>Confidence: 4</li>
        <li>Economic Security: 3</li>
        <li>Coolness under Fire: 3</li>
        <li>Decisiveness: 3</li>
        <li>Enthusiasm: 3</li>
        <li>Freedom: 3</li>
        <li>Friendships: 4</li>
        <li>Having a Family: 3</li>
        <li>Inner Harmony: 4</li>
        <li>Growth: 5</li>
        <li>Independence: 3</li>
        <li>Quality: 3</li>
        <li>Persistence: 3</li>

        <li>Openness: 3</li>
        <li>Inspiration: 4</li>
      </ul>
    <p>To be honest, I could probably list every single value that was suggested to us and put it in this list. To be frank, some of them probably should be in here. I'm still a bit young, but at this point in my life, I know everything I do now will set up what will happen to me a few years down the line. So for me, family is probably one of my top priorties. It's set at 3 now as it's obviously not something I'm focusing on at the moment, but having a father who had traveled for most of his career, it's something that is a high priority to me. Persistence beats resistence. That's someting one of my coworkers used to say to me all the time. It's true. Understanding that there is a light at the end of the tunnel makes the journey worth it. In the end, you'll be a stronger person in some sort of shape or form. Call it being stubborn, but I think in the workplace (especially in coding), you have to have a bit of the trait to knock out those bugs!</p>
    <p>Regarding advice. I don't know if I ever really consider it advice. Whenever I talk to a friend, I will always pass it off as my opinion. To me, advice always seems a bit patronizing at times (unless I'm some certified expert on the field). Though, I will say some people have asked me advice on the persistence bit. And yes, I do value it highly. I used to work in sales, and persistence was absolutely mandatory in order to be successful. So when I do get approached for advice, I will pose it as my thought process and how it works for me because of my personality. What works for me might not work for them. However, I can lay out my thought process to map out how I got to that.</p>
    <p> On a general standpoint, when friends come to me for advice, I usually ask them what their gut is telling them (or they just ask me "hey, is this the right thing to do?"). Barring it harming someone/something ridiculous, at the end of the day, my suggestion is always to go with the gut instinct, because you'll always wonder "what if I had done the other thing instead?".</p>
    <p>It's a bit funny as my values are a bit lined up with the stereotype. I'm a woman who wants financial stability and a family. Combating it in the work-force will be difficult as this will be rightfully assumed. However, as long as you're assertive and confident in yourself, no one will be able to slow you down. Having the inner-harmony and knowing what you want is most of the battle (with execution on the other side of it). The most important thing is to not let it get to your head and reaching out to your friends and family if it does. </p>
    <p>I have yet to encounter anything like DBC yet, so my thoughts on exercises are extremely preliminary. But having an accountability group is starting to form a pretty good bond with each member. By the time we're all together in person, we will probably be very comfortable with approaching each other. I actually would probably reach out to one of the members and express to them my concerns and thoughts if I ever started to slip down the slippery slope. Sometimes all you need to do is to talk it out with someone who does understand the exact process you're going through.</p>
