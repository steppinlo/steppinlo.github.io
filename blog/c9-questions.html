  <h1>Asking a good question</h1><BR>
  <h4>2/22/2015</h4>

  <section="body">
    <p>Growing up, we are always told that there is no such thing as a bad question. Funny thing is, before we know it, some knucklehead who asks a question that had already been either asked, answered, or was put together poorly. This also applies before you even ask the question. </p>
    <h3>Pre-Question</h3>
    <p>First and foremost, check out if its already been asked!! Whenever you have a question, someone else has probably asked the same question! Google has an incredible search engine, as long as you put in the right keywords in the search box, you will most likely find the answer (or a variation of an answer) to your question there.<p>
    <h3>Formulating the question</h3>
    <p>There are a few things to keep in mind when you put together your question. Most importantly, <b>be specific and concise</b>. Nobody wants to wait around and hear a story when they just want to find out your question. What needs to be known to the masses is what your problem is, what you are getting instead, and how you have been tackling your problem. Them being able to replicate the problem will help the most as they can see where and what went wrong. Most importantly, <b>make sure you proofread</b>. Sometimes when we type things out, we don't realize how it sounds to someone who has zero clue what's going on in your head. A high school teacher of mine once told me to read out loud what I wrote as that's the most efficient way of noticing grammatical/awk issues.</p>
    <h3>Title</h3>
    <p>This is going to carry a lot more weight than people realize. Not only will this help you out, but it will help others who probably have the same question. Again, people do not have too much time to read a whole essay and will sometimes just glance over the title/question. You can either make this before or after you write out your predicament. Short and sweet while being specific is the best way to go. If it is something super generic/ambiguous, it will definitely be glanced over. Mentioning what the issue is (e.g. the incorrect result and the desired result) and the parameters will most beneficial.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In short, when you ask a question, you want to be as specific as possible while being as concise. The title should be almost like a tl;dr (too long; didn't read) of your question. The question should go a bit more in depth of your problem so that it can be reproduced (putting the exact code you used works, but only where the problem lies). You also want to make sure the question is readable so that everyone understands it. As long as you make sure all of the above are followed, you will get your answer.</p>
