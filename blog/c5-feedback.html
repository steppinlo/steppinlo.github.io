  <h1>Feedback</h1><BR>
  <h4>1/25/2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>At this point, I've done pair programming quite a number of times and am starting to get a better flow of what is necessary to be done to a)be a good partner and b)be an effective partner. Overall the experience has been nothing short of expectations, if anything, I've learned more about myself and the scope of the field that I'm delving into.</p>
    <p>Now if I take a step back and look at my opinions of pairing in the beginning, I was extremely afraid. This was mainly due to me worrying if I was caught up enough in my knowledge to be able to help out my partner in a beneficial way. At this point I've done it enough times to understand that it's okay to not be at the same level (in reality, it will be the same at work) and other people will have expertise in what you dont know and vice versa. In an environment like that, you can really help each other out and be able to grow together.</p>
    <p>What's fun is that we'll have varying ideas on how to tackle a problem, sometimes we'll be on the same page, most of the time not. For me that's good, there's so many ways to solve a problem in coding, that it's good to know and understand other methods as well. Who knows, maybe that's a more efficient way of doing it! When it comes to that, the partner will actually explain why, and this helps me learn so much more than just reading text. In essence, it's providing a line by line reasoning rather than just "okay this is the code and this is the output". Even if I'm the one who is "slightly ahead", if I need to break down a code and explain it line by line, it's not only benefiting my partner, but also myself. I'm a firm believer that the best way to learn/become an expert in something is also by teaching it. I'm fairly certain when it comes to the rewards, everyone will agree with me when you get the solution right. I've gone to the point of running around the apartment and high fiving myself since you can't quite do that via webcam.</p>
    <p>Feedback has been extremely beneficial. I'll admit it, I'm not the most graceful when it comes to feedback, but I'm doing everything in my power to view it as a constructive argument. This is the bootcamp that will see it in a perspective where I will become a better programmer. I will become a better teammate. It's helpful since most of my feedback has been that I'm not as strong of a communicator at times and can be on a completely different page as my partner. This might be due to the billions of things running through my mind at once. But, what it does make me rethink is my line of thinking. Have a logical flow on how I want to approach the problem and list out to my partner my ideas on how to have it flow. That is something I want to do in all future pairings.</p>
    <p>Writing feedback was extremely difficult at first. I'm always worried I'm structuring my feedback in a negative way that doesn't come across constructive. The last thing I want to do is do a slap in the face and say "hey, you're awful!". But I have to remember that others might be just like me. Even if I want to be nice, I need to let my partner know what problems they might have or how they can improve, otherwise how else would they know?</p>
    <p>Feedback is so important. I'm glad we do it and I think it's highly necessary. Pair programming, although most people probably would want to do it on their own, is a beneficial tool to when we're out working in our future careers. It helps you learn other angles and how to be a better partnr. All in all, I'm DBC has a minimum pair session number. </p>
