  <h1>Conflict</h1><BR>
  <h4>2/14/2015</h4>

  <section="body">
    <p>The last time I had a conflict was probably when things were getting bit messy around the apartment and my roommate and I were getting a lazy with cleaning up after ourselves. It was mainly me getting frustrated with her since she would leave dishes/used cookware in the sink for a good while after they had been used. This caused some grief especially since when I first moved in, one of the things I requested is that dishes don't sit in the sink for more than a day (especially cookware). </p>
    <p>I hate to say it was all my roommate's fault...but it really was! Too many times I had caved in the past and just cleaned them for her, and I think she was beginning to take advantage of it. The basic emotions I felt were frustration, anger, and just flat out irritated.</p>
    <p>Of course no one likes conflict. For a while I would just let the dishes sit hoping she would clean them. Eventually I realized that it was absolutely necessary that I say something or else this would continue, so I made some passing comment for her to clean it up. Eventually she did, but not all of it.</p>
    <p>Honestly, if I could go back, I would just sit her down and explain the situation. Too often people are worried about coming off so negatively that they just make the situation worse. In the future, I plan on just being fully honest with my roommate rather than walking on eggshells. It's better to be upfront. That way, there are no confusions and everyone is on the same page.</p>
