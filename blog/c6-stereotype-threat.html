  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1><BR>
  <h4>1/30/2015</h4>

  <section="body">
    <p>It is said by various studies that when a group is known to be inferior in whatever subject, they are to confirm that specific bias. In multiple studies, notably one with women and mathematics, when the group is informed that they will be compared or be judged on their intellectual capacity, they would confirm the hypothesis. However, when the groups were not informed of such, the groups excelled at the same level. </p>
    <p>Honestly, I find this all too interesting. I'd imagine that having so much pressure to prove everyone wrong catches up to you and you become more nervous because you're trying to do so. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that everyone tries so hard to avoid. As an athlete, I constantly came across this issue. Growing up, I absolutely loved "boy" sports and would participate in plenty of baseball/football programs. Did everyone expect me to fail? You bet. People called me names, it was even attempted for me to get excluded from the program. Why is this? Simply because I was a girl and would supposedly slow it down for everyone due to my skill/dainty-ness. What was even worse was when I was in college, I took up a co-ed flag-football course, all the girls would be the last one chosen (even though some of us turned out to be better than most of the guys there). Gameplay didn't get much better, pretty much every girl was never covered or thrown to. When I finally did get the ball thrown to me (which was the most feeble I-hope-it's-not-too-hard throw, I dropped it since I knew that any future opportunity to catch the ball depended on if I caught it then. Does this mean I was a bad player? No way. Next pass-attempt I caught the ball and ran to the endzone after juking a few defenders.</p>
    <p>Stereotypes in sports is pretty much just as bad as STEM, if not worse. We're not expected to be experts in the subject matter or even be able to hold a reliable conversation. As an Asian-American, I almost feel that my gender is slightly disregarded. Whenever a calculation was needed, being the only Asian, my friends would ask me first. They'd even make jokes that mathematics was probably my favorite subject in school.</p>
    <p>My biggest concern moving forward is being judged as an indiviual and not as a female. I do not need the feeble terrible throws to continue. I want to be regarded as an equal individual to my peers. In the workplace, people should have the same level of empathy/harshness to everyone, except in the case of seniority. If we want the company to continue its growth, which should be the main objective of the company, then everyone needs to be excelling to the best of their abilities. With all the stereotypes across genders/ethnicities, everyone will deal with adversities in some way. However, as Alfred says in Batman Begins, "It's what you do that defines you".</p>
